‘‘No One Yet Knows

Carson Transformed
Scientific Uncertainty
Into a Site for Public
Participation in Silent
Spring

Kenny Walker1 and Lynda Walsh2

Abstract
This article examines Rachel Carson’s assimilation and revision of scientific
uncertainty in her sources, annotations, and drafts for Silent Spring. It argues
that Carson’s emphasis on the special topos of uncertainty was not an
original
invention but instead was Carson’s contribution to an ongoing
scientific and political conversation about uncertainty in 1962. Carson
transformed this topos into a bridge across the is–ought divide in
science-related policy making, using the uncertainty topos to invite the

public to participate by supplying fears and values that would warrant pro-
posals for limiting pesticide use. Carson’s adaptation of scientific uncer-
tainty to environmental policy making provides a historical precedent for
contemporary invocations of scientific uncertainty in debates surrounding
global warming, nuclear power, cancer studies, and Gulf oil drilling. The
methods that the authors use to trace the development of this special topos
can also serve as a pattern for excavating the histories of other pivotal topoi
in the rhetoric of American science and environmental policy.

Recently on National Public Radio (NPR), Melissa Block (2010) interviewed
Lisa Jackson, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, on the use of
dispersants to break up the Deepwater Horizon spill. The interview hinged
on the uncertainty about the dispersant’s toxicity and, therefore, about the
wisdom of using it. Here is a brief excerpt, with language related to uncer-
tainty italicized:

Block: Is it fair to say, do you think, that we really don’t know the effects
of this dispersant when it’s used in such quantities and injected into such
depths in the water?

Jackson: I think it’s fair to say that those [factors: quantity and depth] are both
novel to this response . . . But we’re having to get science on the fly. We are
having to collect data every day and review the data to make sure we’re not
making a bad situation any worse. And remember, although these are chemi-
cals, they are less toxic than the oil, and we have millions of gallons of oil
being released out there.

Block: There are, though, a number of scientists and environmentalists who
would dispute that or say, we just don’t know how toxic it is. Oil may break
down; we have no idea whether Core-Exit will break down, especially when
it’s used at depth.

Jackson: Well, I think anybody can inject lots of questions into the system. I
have them, too. I don’t want to minimize the concern. But when you have to
make a decision during the response, it’s whether to take [dispersants] off the
table completely. And there are some good reasons not to do that. (paras. 9-13)

This exchange echoes interviews aired nearly 50 years earlier as part of the
famous broadcast ‘‘The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson.’’ Columbia Broad-
casting System (CBS) anchor Eric Sevareid and correspondent Jay

McMullen posed a series of questions prompted by Carson’s (1962/2002)
argument about pesticide use to agricultural scientists. The questions were
similar to Block’s (2010) and received similar answers (again, with the lan-
guage related to uncertainty italicized):

Sevareid: Charges and countercharges had been made, but the glare of con-
troversy tended to obscure acknowledgment on all sides that a pesticide prob-
lem does exist. How serious this problem may be is at issue. First, according
to the Public Health Service, at least a hundred and fifty persons die in this
nation every year as a result of acute pesticide poisoning, but . . . the total
number of injuries or illnesses caused by pesticides each year is unknown.
The former Secretary of the American Medical Association Pesticide Com-
mittee, now disbanded, Dr. Bernard Conley:

Conley: There are no accurate statistics on the incidence of non-fatal pesti-
cide poisoning throughout the country. This is due to the difficulty of diagnos-
ing such cases, as well as the lack of state requirements for the reporting of
non-fatal pesticide poisoning . . .

Sevareid: Jay McMullen put this question to Dr. Arnold Lehman, Chief Tox-
icologist, Food and Drug Administration:

McMullen: For some pesticides you set a zero tolerance, meaning that no
residue of those pesticides may be present on crops when they’re marketed.
Why not set zero tolerance for all pesticides?

Lehman: I wish I could answer that question in a happy mood, but I can’t,
because the insects won’t cooperate. Some insects wait until the crop is
mature and then attack the mature crop, and nature provides the time of the
appearance of the insects when their food crop is at its best.

McMullen: In other words, you might have to use a pesticide very soon before
the crop is being harvested, because it’s being attacked?

Lehman: That’s right . . . . (Sevareid & McMullen, 1963, pp. 13-14, 25)

Just as in the Block–Jackson interview, Sevareid and McMullen first
prod the scientist they are interviewing to admit he is uncertain about
the health effects of pesticides, but later the scientist counters by raising
the damage to food supplies that would result from withholding the
chemical in question.

That both dialogues employ strategies pivoting on uncertainty is proba-
bly not coincidental. The way we argue about industrial toxins and the envi-
ronment in the United States today owes a great debt to Silent Spring. This

6

thesis has already been put forth by a large volume of work on the public
and industry reception of Silent Spring (Graham, 1970; Groshong, 2007;
Murphy, 2005; Smith, 2001), on the book’s influence on the environmen-
tal movement (Cronon & Dunlap, 2008; Lytle, 2007), on Carson’s rheto-
rical strategies (Bryson, 2003; Killingsworth & Palmer, 1992; Waddell,
2000), and on its interactions with media coverage of environmental
issues (Kroll, 2001). Although we support this thesis, our reasons for
doing so differ from those that have been put forth to this point and pro-
vide a basis for evaluating contemporary environmental debates such as
Block and Jackson’s.

Previous authors have tended to focus on the reception of Silent Spring,
thus leaving to the side the task of contextualizing the composition of the
book’s rhetorical strategies, which did not spring from Carson’s head fully
formed but were a result of her active participation in an in-progress polit-
ical and scientific conversation in the postwar period that foregrounded
uncertainty. Situating Silent Spring in this wider context helps us trace more
reliable connections between its treatment of uncertainty and current treat-
ments, such as the Block-Jackson interchange.

In this article, we examine how Carson, in composing Silent Spring,
assimilated scientific uncertainty from the scientific literature she read and
from conversations she had with its authors. We document this assimilation
using archival clippings, annotations, and drafts from the Rachel Carson
papers at Yale University. Then we use stasis theory to explicate how Car-
son transformed scientific uncertainty in Silent Spring into a rhetorical
access point for her readers to stake a claim in arguments about pesticide
use. Carson’s use of uncertainty thus provides an important counterpoint
to previous treatments of uncertainty as an obstructionist topos—a catalyst
of epistemic filibuster aimed at undermining scientific authority in public
debate and stalling civic action.

Carson’s (1962/2002) rhetorical project—to keep the public in ‘‘full pos-
session of the facts’’ because ‘‘it is the public that must decide’’ (p. 13)—is
as relevant to our time as it was to hers. Once we understand how uncer-
tainty functions as a scaffold for public participation in science, then we can
explain why debaters such as Block and Jackson might wish to invoke it in
discussions of environmental policy. Here is our argument about its func-
tion in brief: Uncertainty is a multifaceted strategy, laying the rhetorical
groundwork for responses, ranging from conservative to progressive, to a
political dilemma. The winning party, then, will be the one who can supply,
in the face of uncertainty, the most compelling portrait of a possible

outcome, whether dystopian or utopian. This potential outcome serves as a
target to be either achieved or avoided via policy.

Uncertainty in Carson Research

Given how much has been written about Carson and the effects Silent
Spring had on public debates, it is surprising that no one has written about
her reception and composition of scientific uncertainty. Perhaps the biggest
danger in attempting to remedy this oversight would be to begin by assum-
ing that Carson’s strategies regarding uncertainty were original and suc-
cessful because policy that Carson called for in the book was indeed
enacted. Paul, Charney, and Kendall (2001) identified this approach as the
chief pitfall of rhetorical analyses of landmark scientific texts such as Silent
Spring. As an antidote to post hoc analysis, the authors call instead for ‘‘dia-
chronic studies . . .
[that] explor[e] the evolving nature of knowledge
within a community and . . . examin[e] the contemporary rhetoric of scien-
tific revolutions’’ (p. 391). Likewise, in his edited collection of rhetorical
analyses of Silent Spring, And No Birds Sing, Waddell (2000) challenged
Carson scholars to ‘‘consider not only multiple factors within the text but
also the influence of other texts and of the historical context’’ (p. 12).

One of the few essays that bucks the post hoc reception trend in Carson
scholarship is Oravec’s (2000) study of the inventional processes behind ‘‘A
Fable for Tomorrow,’’ Silent Spring’s famous first chapter. Oravec pursued
a method that analyzes Carson’s source material and drafting process,
which, she claimed, ‘‘aim[s] to uncover the content, alternatives, and out-
comes of Carson’s rhetorical choices and to generate a narrative . . . [that
uncovers] the source of a rhetor’s strategic moves as though they were
eavesdropping upon an evolving inventional conversation’’ (p. 45). But
Oravec’s instructive methodological work is limited to the introduction of
Silent Spring. We could benefit, then, from an extension of Oravec’s project
to a broader consideration of the strategies Carson employed throughout
Silent Spring to encourage the manufacture of political certainty from sci-
entific uncertainty. But first we review the relevant research and historicize
uncertainty and scientific ethos in the postwar period.

Scientific Uncertainty in Postwar America

As is evident in both the NPR and CBS excerpts, uncertainty is a compli-
cated topos. The interlocutors are treating at least two flavors of uncertainty
simultaneously, and probably more. One type of uncertainty is ignorance—

8

Journal of Business and Technical Communication 26(1)

about the effects of Core-Exit and DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane),
respectively (Smithson, 1989). The other type invokes risk assessment
(weighing the damage done by the chemicals against the damage done by
their targets, oil and insects, if left unmolested). These flavors of uncer-
tainty, as they appear in public debates on scientific issues, have received
a great deal of attention from scholars. But exactly how ignorance is trans-
lated rhetorically into risk has gone unexplained to this point. Our investi-
gation of Carson’s composing process provides a rare look inside this
process, and stasis theory helps structure an explanation of how uncertainty
can be converted into a call to action based on perceived risks.

Some scholars have sought to construct a rhetoric of uncertainty. For
example, Danisch (2010) turned to the sociological theories of Ulrich Beck
to reanimate a notion of scientific prudence. Danisch called for a flexible
understanding of scientific uncertainty that, in the face of a polarized and
emotionally charged political culture, would cultivate ‘‘a democratic capac-
ity for all kinds of citizens to engage in acts of deliberation about scientific
and technical matters . . . [and] foster the development of sites of connection
and exchange between citizens and scientists, so that a collective, moral,
and technical vision of our future could be authored’’ (p. 190). Along
related lines, sociologist Campbell (1985) contended that ‘‘the problem of
uncertainty is not fundamentally quantitative. It is a problem of social def-
inition and negotiation’’ (p. 450).

Shackley and Wynne (1996) identified uncertainty as a ‘‘boundary dis-
course’’ that serves as rhetorical common ground for both politicians and
scientists in issues such as global warming. All of these stakeholders believe
uncertainty is a key problem although their individual definitions of the
term do not necessarily agree. In this cultural contact zone, scientists have
developed strategies for ‘‘translating’’ uncertainty into an actionable polit-
ical commodity: displacement, reduction, scheduling into the future, trans-
formation, and condensation (pp. 282-288). In all of these strategic
scenarios, scientists are the rhetorical drivers, and their goal is safeguarding
their social status and autonomy. How, then, do nonscientists co-opt scien-
tific uncertainty at these sites of connection?

A group of rhetoricians have begun studying articulations of uncertainty
by nonscientific stakeholders in public science debates. Sauer (2003) ana-
lyzed how the articulation of scientific uncertainty can be used as a reflec-
tive and epistemic tool for the integration of stakeholder knowledge with
technical expertise in risk scenarios: ‘‘By drawing attention to what we
do not know, the process can help us develop methods to increase our
understanding of risk. This process can take place within scientific

Walker and Walsh

communities, but stakeholders can also contribute to the process’’ (p. 100).
Within technical communication, Graham and Lindeman (2005) have noted
how rhetorical strategies may reflect different social values (p. 424)
whereas Journet (2010) has revealed how rhetorical and epistemic uses of
ambiguous language in scientific discourse can create the ‘‘context for the
work and the framing of the argument’’ (p. 30). Similarly, Zehr (1999) has
called for an awareness of how scientific uncertainty can be managed for
political purposes because this awareness helps to ‘‘demystify science and
increases the amount of influence that the public can exercise over decisions
that affect their lives’’ (p. 3).

Building on these scholarly foundations, recent work has focused on how
industry representatives and other critics of scientific authority leverage
scientific uncertainty to delay policy action (Michaels, 2008; Mitchell,
2000; Oreskes & Conway, 2010; Paroske, 2009).1 These studies, while
compelling, can limit our appreciation of uncertainty as a flexible topos that
shareholders can use to promote as well as to delay policy action through
the dissemination of information (or the lack thereof). We see such a view
of uncertainty in literature on the precautionary principle—the political
principle that in the face of uncertainty, action should be taken to limit pub-
lic exposure to risk. Peel’s (2005) work suggests that when uncertainty is
defined narrowly, as simply arising within the science, policy makers and
stakeholders tend to ‘‘overlook the real value of the precautionary princi-
ple’’ (p. 54) and make decisions that increase public risk. But stakeholders’
behavior changes within a broader view of scientific uncertainty that
encompasses ‘‘an assessment of what is not yet known and may be unknow-
able.’’ This type of uncertainty

cannot be divorced from questions of ‘‘value’’ since the extent to which a
threat gives rise to concern will influence decisions about the level of caution
employed. The mix of ‘‘fact’’ and ‘‘value’’ that occurs in the assessment of
threats of damage takes the precautionary decision-making process beyond
the realm of science alone. (p. 55)

Under this scenario, stakeholders tend to respond to uncertainty by arti-
culating their personal moral conviction that damage should be limited
or avoided.

This previous work on the rhetoric of uncertainty in scientific debates
suggests that uncertainty is an important boundary discourse, a site in
which scientists and their public can negotiate in policy making, and that
articulating uncertainty can produce varied political and rhetorical effects,

10

Journal of Business and Technical Communication 26(1)

depending on who articulates it and to what end. When scientists articulate
uncertainty, they usually do so to safeguard their ethos from attack; when
other stakeholders articulate scientific uncertainty, they often do so to
undercut scientific ethos and stymie the political action based on scientific
recommendations.

But the previous scholarship has not yet answered this question: What is
the rhetorical mechanism by which stakeholders transform scientific uncer-
tainty into the political certainty (albeit limited and provisional) prerequi-
site to policy? Shackley and Wynne (1996) came closest to explaining
how uncertainty becomes certainty via their ‘‘translation’’ strategies, but
they only presented brief sketches of these strategies, and they focused
exclusively on scientists as agents in arguments about climate change. A
more general rhetoric of scientific certainty/uncertainty in policy making
remains to be assembled.

If scientific ethos is the prime target of articulations of scientific cer-
tainty/uncertainty, as previous research has indicated, then understanding
American scientific ethos proves key to understanding how uncertainty is
transformed into certainty in debates about science policy—both in Silent
Spring and in present environmental debates.

Uncertainty and Scientific Ethos in Postwar America

According to Shapin (2008) and Pielke (2007), postwar scientific ethos
developed a schism that can be described by the Enlightenment is–ought
stricture. This stricture held that moral certainty, or what we ought to do
in a given political dilemma, cannot logically be derived from scientific cer-
tainty, or observations of what is in the natural world.

Before the war, American scientists and policy makers generally coop-
erated according to the rules of the progressive ‘‘linear model.’’ In this
model, ‘‘achieving agreement on scientific knowledge is a prerequisite for
a political consensus to be reached and then policy action to occur’’ (Pielke,
2007, p. 13). But in the wake of wartime abuses of scientific authority—
Nazi medical horrors, the atom bomb, radiation experiments—policy mak-
ers increasingly required scientists to abjure statements of political certainty
(cf. the stripping of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s security clearance in 1954).
Scientists were now supposed to hand off their knowledge across the is–
ought divide to policy makers. Thus, the ideal developed of the ‘‘pure’’
scientist or science arbiter who is concerned only with factual descriptions
of natural phenomena (Pielke, 2007; Shapin, 2008). But this ethical myth
served only to proliferate political uncertainty (Danisch, 2010). Voters and

Walker and Walsh

policy makers became anxious because their knowledge of scientifically
related situations felt partial and uncertain; on the other side of the
‘‘divide,’’ scientists were anxious to avoid language that sounded too cer-
tain in reporting their findings to the media because they feared being
branded ‘‘issue advocates’’ (Pielke, 2007).

In this postwar period of heightened scientific and political uncertainty,
Carson began composing Silent Spring. Thus, her composition process pro-
vides the perfect opportunity to specify how postwar scientific ethos inter-
acted with the manufacture of political certainty from scientific uncertainty.
To enact such an examination, we pose three research questions about
uncertainty in the composition of Silent Spring:

1. How was Carson able to assimilate uncertainty from the articulations of

the scientists she read and corresponded with?

2. How did she adopt and adapt these treatments of uncertainty in her

drafts of Silent Spring?

3. Given the constraints on scientific ethos in the postwar period, how
exactly did she encourage the formation of political certainties from
articulations of scientific uncertainties about DDT? A detailed account
of Carson’s composition strategies relating to scientific uncertainty
may provide a basis for investigating current articulations of scientific
uncertainty in environmental policy making.

Methodology

In examining Carson’s treatment of uncertainty in the drafting of Silent
Spring, we propose scientific uncertainty as a special topos operating in
popular accounts of scientific findings. Many rhetorical scholars have also
applied classical topoi as analytical tools (Leff, 1983; Miller, 1987; Miller
& Selzer, 1985; Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969; Prelli, 1989; Walsh,
2010; Winterowd, 1973). Walsh likened an author’s selection of a topos for
use in considering and writing about a subject to ‘‘selecting a stance from
which to view a landscape’’ or ‘‘a slice through a data set’’ (pp. 125-126).
In either conception, conducting an analysis through a topos is a way to fore-
ground chosen thematic elements while leaving others to the margins or out-
side the field of view altogether. In arguing that uncertainty is a special topos
of public arguments about environmental science, we are following Miller
and Selzer’s treatment of the special topoi of engineering reports.

In defining the special topos of scientific uncertainty, we begin with the
is concise without

definition put forth by Pielke (2007) because it

12

Journal of Business and Technical Communication 26(1)

sacrificing the multiplicity of the term. He defined scientific uncertainty as
‘‘a situation with more than one outcome consistent with our understand-
ing,’’ a situation that can be further subdivided into ignorance (‘‘we do not
know’’) and risk (a probability distribution of likely outcomes; pp. 55-57).
The concepts of ignorance and risk usefully distinguish articulations of sci-
entific and political uncertainty. In scientific uncertainty, ignorance claims
define the boundaries of knowledge and admit limitations and restrictions.
These ignorance claims are often used in scientific discourses to call for
more research or to qualify the scope of findings. At the level of political
uncertainty, risk presents to policy makers the likelihood of a range of
well-defined outcomes.

We applied this definition of the scientific uncertainty topos to Carson’s
composing process as follows: First, we identified inductively key phrases
associated with scientific uncertainty in the published text; here we used a
similar method to that of Walsh (2009a) and Miller and Selzer (1985). Once
we had identified by hand a set of phrases that consistently reoccurred with
discussions of scientific uncertainty in the text, we used the search func-
tion on Google books for each phrase to make sure we had marked
all instances of use for each phrase. This process produced a set of five
commonly repeated key phrases that coded uncertainty (we do not know,
little-understood, more research needed, lack of consensus, and potential
for harm) as well as a set of locations of discussions of uncertainty
throughout the text. Table 1 presents brief quotes of all of these articula-
tions in Silent Spring, grouped by the five codes. While some of these
codes do appear in previous studies of linguistic hedging in scientific dis-
course (Hartnett, 2004; Hyland, 1998), we did not include other hedges in
our notations because we were more interested in full-fledged articula-
tions of scientific uncertainty than we were in Carson’s attitudes toward
the content of particular scientific claims.2

Once we identified the five codes for uncertainty, we sorted articulations
of them according to the is–ought stricture of scientific ethos to see whether
that mapping might help us specify the ways that Carson encouraged the
formation of political certainty from scientific uncertainty. To specify and
rhetoricize the is–ought stricture, we employed Fahnestock and Secor’s
(1988) model of stasis theory in scientific argumentation (see Appendix for
a summary and examples of stasis theory). We used stasis theory for this
purpose because the linear model of science–society integration is predi-
cated on the classical stases of argumentation: In this model, as rhetors
accumulate more information about facts, definitions, and causes and
effects, they become better equipped to decide what is the right thing to

do—that is, as they become more scientifically certain, they become more
politically certain. As a check on this progressive model, the is–ought con-
straint blocked scientists from taking the otherwise natural step from obser-
ving the effects of pesticides, for instance, to making value judgments about
their public use (Walsh, 2009b); rhetorically speaking, then, the is–ought

16

Journal of Business and Technical Communication 26(1)

divide lives between the stases of cause–effect and value. Because of this
correspondence between the linear model of science–society integration
and the stases of argumentation, we believed stasis theory might help us
explain the rhetorical mechanism for transforming articulations of scientific
uncertainty, ironically, into political certainty. So we copied the full quotes
in which uncertainty codes appeared in Silent Spring and arranged them
according to the stases of argumentation to see how they articulated with
each other across the is–ought divide.

Here is an example of how we determined stasis for a particular articu-
lation of an uncertainty code. In chapter 2, Carson stated that ‘‘the central
problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man’s total
environment with such substances of incredible potential for harm’’ (1962/
2002, p. 8). First, we tagged the key phrase, potential for harm. Then, we
looked to the context for clues to the stasis at which Carson was articulating
uncertainty here: In concert with the phrases problem and contamination,
we decided that potential for harm in this case articulated risk at the stasis
of value (contamination is a strongly negative outcome). Table 2 presents a
matrix of the results of this process for all 33 articulations of the five uncer-
tainty codes throughout Silent Spring. We looked for patterns in this matrix
that might elucidate Carson’s strategy for articulating uncertainty.

After the initial coding of the published text was complete, we
repeated the process in Carson’s (ca. 1946-1962) archived manuscripts
at Yale University. We worked chronologically through the book chap-
ters, which is also how the archival manuscripts are arranged. In both the
source-materials folders and the drafts folders, we searched for sites that
articulated uncertainty, using the codes identified in the published text;
during this process, we were vigilant for uncertainty codes that never
made it to print, but since we did not find any, the five original codes
proved to be a robust analytic set.

In every folder of source material, we transcribed each of Carson’s anno-
tations and marginalia about uncertainty on extant sources relating to all 33
sites in Silent Spring where uncertainty was articulated. This process
allowed us to witness where and how Carson assimilated scientific uncer-
tainty from the published literature of her time, as well as what she did and
did not end up using in Silent Spring.

For the draft manuscripts, we used the uncertainty codes as tracers to
track the inventional and revision processes behind each articulation of
uncertainty in every chapter. For each of the 33 articulations of uncertainty,
we noted in which draft it first appeared and any changes throughout the
drafting process. If an articulation was used consistently from early to late

drafts or if an articulation dropped out of the drafts over time, we noted it. If
any of the articulations changed significantly from one draft to another, we
noted where it changed and transcribed the changes from one draft to
another. We looked at each folder in sequence without anticipating the
changes in Carson’s drafting process. Following Oravec’s (2000) model,
we were able to document Carson’s evolving strategies (p. 58). We could
witness how and where Carson revised for her articulation of scientific
uncertainty and begin to ask why.

Results and Discussion

By mapping articulations of uncertainty in Silent Spring to the stases of
argument, we discovered an interesting pattern in the textual data (see Table
2): Articulations of uncertainty associated with ignorance codes (we do not
know, little understood, and more research needed) tended to cluster around
the stases of fact, definition, and cause–effect, signaling scientific uncer-
tainty about what is rather than political uncertainty about what we ought
to do. Similarly, articulations of uncertainty associated with the lack of con-
sensus code signaled uncertainty about the scientific knowledge base (see
Table 1). Here, Carson presented competing scientific theories as just
another form of ignorance for the purposes of public debate (i.e., scientists
are our instruments for knowing the world, and since they are giving con-
flicting readings, we do not know what it is).

By contrast, articulations associated with risk codes (variants of poten-
tial for harm) tended to cluster around the stasis of value (see Table 2) as
they invoked negative evaluations of possible outcomes of pesticide use.

We use this stasis pattern to ground our explanations of the rhetorical
effects of Carson’s composition strategies, which we turn to now. We
present and discuss results in two subsections keyed to our research ques-
tions: First, we treat Carson’s assimilation of uncertainty from the in-
progress scientific conversation around her; second, we treat Carson’s
drafting choices that revise articulations of certainty into articulations
of uncertainty for final presentation.

Assimilation of Scientific Uncertainty From Sources

Carson’s annotations and drafts leave little doubt that her uses of scientific
uncertainty in Silent Spring came directly from her scientific sources. Car-
son made this scientific influence legible in the archival materials in three
ways: She wrote marginalia in her source material marking uses of

Walker and Walsh

19

uncertainty, even when she did not quote these passages in the final text; she
pulled direct quotes from scientists who invoked uncertainty and placed
them into the text; and she amplified uncertainty from her sources, engaging
prior treatments in conversations as she adapted them to her argument in
Silent Spring. Although we cannot discuss each of Carson’s 33 articulations
of uncertainty in Silent Spring, we provide a few examples in each category to
make her larger patterns of use clear. In each instance, we explain the rheto-
rical effect of her chosen strategy by referring to the stasis pattern we found in
Carson’s use of uncertainty throughout the composition process.

Carson’s Source Annotations and Marginalia

One of Carson’s more interesting rhetorical experiments with scientific
uncertainty, one that she finally abandoned, reveals her desire to put scien-
tific claims in humanistic perspective. In Carson’s (ca. 1946-1962) source
material for the parable that opens Silent Spring, ‘‘A Fable for Tomorrow,’’
she noted that a central theme of her work would be ‘‘domination by the
engineer—the practical techneer who knows HOW to do almost any-
thing—but not whether it should be done’’ (Chapter source material, intro-
duction). The political and humanistic questions of why, whether, and for
what purpose were central concerns for Carson. In a guest editorial by poet
Van Doren (1959), for a June issue of the Saturday Review, Carson (ca.
1946-1962) underlined the passage in which Van Doren frames the uncer-
tainty that connects science and politics (uncertainty codes are italicized):

The crisis appears in our nervous recognition that the age of science in which
we say we live seems to be an age in which we do not know what we are
doing, or why we are doing it, or whether we should. We have lost a sense
of where the center is, and therefore where the boundaries are. We are fever-
ishly active, toward we do not know what end. Our motto is more and more,
not better and better. (p. 26)

The fact that she marked this passage suggests that she too was concerned
with the ignorance in our actions—that we had lost a sense of purpose and
direction. Although no direct acknowledgments of ignorance and uncer-
tainty appear in the introductory fable, early versions did contain direct
references, such as ‘‘the death of spring and the denial of life in Green Mea-
dows had been brought about, thoughtlessly and unknowingly [emphasis
added], by the people of the community themselves’’ (Carson, Early drafts,
introduction). Carson’s reception of uncertainty from humanistic sources,
then, framed it in a way that revealed our ignorance of the mechanisms

20

Journal of Business and Technical Communication 26(1)

of chemicals and the risks that might result from their use. Although this use
of uncertainty is only implied in the final introduction, Carson clearly
sought to use uncertainty to expose the limits of scientific knowledge to the
public and raise the question of whether we should bear the potential risks
of chemical pesticides.

As she did with Van Doren’s use of uncertainty, Carson underlined and
annotated many passages that articulated uncertainty in the scientific source
materials for Silent Spring but eventually decided not to incorporate these ele-
ments. Take, for instance, her source material for chapter 14, ‘‘One in Every
Four,’’ a chapter on the ratio in 1962 of Americans who would be diagnosed
with cancer sometime in their life. Although uncertainty cannot be found in
the chapter, it is in her source marginalia. For example, in a paper by two
Mayo Clinic doctors titled, ‘‘Leukemia and Lymphoma—Environmental
Diseases?’’ Carson (ca. 1946-1962) underlined the following quotation:

Although not all persons with a significant history of exposure will become
victims of leukemia or lymphoma, all persons with lymphoma or leukemia
do have a significant history of the exposure in question [synthetic agents].
No explanation of mode of production of leukemia or lymphoma resulting
from such contacts is offered, but if our conclusion is valid, the entire field
of prevention and treatment of these disease states must be re-evaluated.
(Chapter source material XIV)

Although in the final draft of chapter 14, Carson listed numerous cases
proving these doctors’ conclusion that ‘‘all persons with leukemia and lym-
phoma do have a significant history of the exposure in question,’’ why did
Carson omit the authors’ expressions of uncertainty and ignorance? To put
this question in perspective, throughout chapters 14 and 15 in the published
text, articulations of scientific uncertainty drop off across the board. Perhaps,
as Fahnestock (1986) suggested in her study of popularizations, Carson does
not want to erode the significance of her central claim that cancer can be
linked to environmental causes. Carson’s strategy here may have revolved
around building a crescendo through copia, by presenting so many dramatic
case studies of environmentally caused cancers they seem to go on forever. If
that was the case, articulations of uncertainty may have undercut the over-
whelming emotional appeal she seems to be reaching for in this section.

Direct Quotes of Uncertainty

Carson also assimilated uncertainty from the contemporary scientific con-
versation by directly quoting the scientists who invoke the topos. By using
direct quotes, Carson reinforced the notion of uncertainty as an inherent

Walker and Walsh

21

aspect of the scientific process—a process based upon probability, contin-
gency, and risk taking. For example, in the chapter ‘‘Surface Waters and
Underground Seas,’’ Carson (1962/2002) framed surface water pollution
as part of a larger reservoir that eventually becomes part of every under-
ground stream and public water supply. She quoted a scientist who, through
uncertainty, acknowledged both the ignorance inherent in the science and
its potentially dangerous effects:

Professor Rolf Eliassen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology testified
before a congressional committee to the impossibility of predicting the com-
posite effect of these chemicals, or of identifying the organic matter resulting
from the mixture. ‘‘We don’t begin to know [emphasis added] what that is,’’
said Professor Eliassen. ‘‘What is the effect on the people? We don’t know
[emphasis added].’’ (p. 40)

The scientist’s acknowledgment of scientific uncertainty, rearticulated in
Carson’s (ca. 1946-1962) widely published book, opened up a rhetorical
space for the public awareness of risk. One paragraph later, when Carson
reviewed toxicity tests on municipal water supplies that killed every fish,
and when she attached these case studies to such statements as ‘‘our waters
have become almost universally contaminated with insecticides’’ (p. 41),
the consequences of ignorance and potentials for harm were amplified. Car-
son’s rhetorical strategy was to use a scientist to admit scientific uncer-
tainty, thereby inviting public valuation of the subject. Not only did
scientists not know what toxins were in the water or what the effect on peo-
ple might be, but the example of the fish that Carson provided vividly
demonstrated the potentially lethal effects that such contaminants had on
living organisms. When Carson connected the image of lethal waters to sci-
entific uncertainty, she invited readers to supply the lacking certainty; after
all, they were certain they wanted clean drinking water. Just as in other
instances of the precautionary principle (Peel, 2005), a broader definition
of uncertainty allowed stakeholders to insert their public valuation into the
argument. Carson’s text invited readers to critique science on the levels of
both knowledge production (we should know what is in our water), and
civic action amid risk (there should not be toxic chemicals in our water).
the book, Carson quoted scientists who
acknowledge scientific uncertainty. These quotes were a powerful tool to
shape readers’ access to her carefully selected case studies. Without such
acknowledgment of scientific uncertainty, Carson’s polemic was a barrage
of terrifying anecdotes. By invoking the topos of scientific uncertainty,
however, Carson was able to transform the anecdotes from isolated cases

Seven times throughout

22

Journal of Business and Technical Communication 26(1)

into a unified code pointing to a fundamental instability in the knowledge
base, the ‘‘is’’ of the science. These carefully situated uncertainty claims
framed science as an open question needing the answer of public evaluation.

Amplifying Uncertainty

Finally, Carson revised articulations of uncertainty in her sources to add the
higher stasis functions of risk to lower stasis ignorance claims. In the same
chapter on water pollution, Carson (1962/2002) began by invoking both
ignorance and risk: ‘‘Within the groups of chemicals themselves there are sin-
ister and little-understood [emphasis added] interactions, transformations,
and summations of effect,’’ which she translated from many sources (p.
39). The predominant source for this claim was a report from the Journal
of American Waterworks Association, in which Carson (ca. 1946-1962)
underlined the following: ‘‘We know comparatively little about the concen-
tration of pesticide chemicals now in water . . . . Investigations to determine
the concentrations of pesticides in such situations are needed particularly’’
(Chapter source material IV). As is typical of disciplinary scientific dis-
course, the authors of this report acknowledged the limitations of their scope
and called for more research. Carson amplified her sources by adding to articu-
lations of ignorance a level of risk, the ‘‘sinister . . . summations of effect.’’
According to Carson, not only did we not know what was there, but what was
there was likely disposed to harm human welfare; it was sinister. In the disci-
plinary context, uncertainty is ignorance and a call for research. Carson’s
amplification adds a moral valence, inviting the readers once again to attach
their fears and values to what was originally a ‘‘purely’’ scientific debate.

Revising from Certainty to Uncertainty

Perhaps our most significant finding from the archival research was that in
Carson’s drafting process, she took out certainty clauses multiple times and
replaced them with uncertainty codes to frame crucial parts of her research.
This finding was unexpected because previous research had predicted that
uncertainties would be stripped from popularizations (Fahnestock, 1986;
Hartnett, 2004) and that articulations of uncertainty would serve to delay,
not promote, science policy and regulation (Michaels, 2008; Mitchell,
2000; Oreskes & Conway, 2010; Paroske, 2009). One early example of Car-
son’s unique revision strategy came early in chapter 3, ‘‘Elixirs of Death.’’
This chapter is largely an exposition of the various chemical pesticides and
the potential harm they can cause. Although science writing was

Walker and Walsh

23

characterized by accurate descriptions of what was known and certain, Car-
son made choices in her drafting process that foreground what was
unknown and uncertain. In an early draft of a passage that conveys uncer-
tainty (Carson, 1962/2002, p. 23), uncertainty is almost entirely absent:

This storage of DDT begins with the smallest conceivable intake of the chem-
ical (which is present as residues on most foodstuffs) and continues until quite
high levels are reached. The fatty storage deposits act as biological magni-
fiers, so that an intake of as little as one tenth of one part per million in the
diet results in storage of about 10 to 15 parts per million, an increase of
one-hundred-fold or more. Dr. Arnold Lehman, the chief pharmacologist of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, says that there is neither a floor
below which DDT is not absorbed nor a ceiling beyond which absorption and
storage ceases . . . . But these terms of reference, so common place to the che-
mist or pharmacologist, are unfamiliar to most of us. One part of a million
sounds like a very small amount—and so it is. But these are substances of
such enormous potency that a very small amount can bring about vast
changes in the body . . . . In fact, the outstanding feature of chronic poisoning
by DDT is liver damage, whereas acute poisoning is characterized by distur-
bances of the central nervous system . . . . There has been no such parallel sit-
uation in medical history. We have some intimations as to what the ultimate
consequences may be, but it is too early to know the full story. (Carson, ca.
1946-1962, Early drafts chapter III)

What is striking about this early draft is how filled with certainties it is
Carson told us how DDT is stored in the human body, about the body’s
potentially limitless capacity for absorbing DDT, and about the multiple
effects of such DDT buildup. She cited the USDA (United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture) scientist and then told readers why they should care
about such small numbers. Finally, she underscored the effects of both acute
and chronic conditions, ending with the passage’s only concession to uncer-
tainty: ‘‘We have some intimations . . . but it is too early to know,’’ which
Carson underlined.

This concession turned out to be the seed crystal around which prolifer-
ated a whole series of revisions. In the published version, Carson (1962/
2002) did not begin by telling us how DDT was stored in the human body,
she began by foregrounding scientific uncertainty at the lower stases of
argument, ‘‘Scientists do not agree upon how much DDT can be stored in
the human body,’’ and by giving us the two conflicting viewpoints: One
scientist claimed there was neither a floor nor a ceiling for storage; the other
claimed there was a ceiling, and the body excreted all excess DDT. But as

24

Journal of Business and Technical Communication 26(1)

Carson suggested, for all practical purposes it did not matter who was right
since ‘‘the minimum figures are above the level at which damage to the liver
and other organs or tissues may begin’’ (p. 22).

What motivated these revisions to foreground uncertainty? The stasis
model offers some explanatory power: First, uncertainty destabilizes the
is of the scientific discourse, foregrounding ignorance and lack of consensus
in the scientific community. This failure to establish a firm foundation for
political action at the lower stases invites an evaluative repair: By activating
their fear of liver damage, readers pull the argument across the is–ought
divide into their jurisdiction—the realm of moral and political certainty
at the higher stases. By bringing readers into this risk territory, Carson could
then present her carefully chosen case studies to drive home her warnings
about the potential health effects of DDT.

If she had led with her opinion that DDT was harmful and should be
banned, she might have risked exposing herself to the ethical conundrum
of the is–ought divide: If she was in fact the scientist that she represented
herself to be, what business would she have telling the reader what to
do? If, on the other hand, she was a concerned citizen, what would give
her the scientific authority to opine on the consequences of DDT use?
By foregrounding uncertainty between scientists, Carson shifted to them
the ethical burden of establishing what is. Then their lack of consensus
authorized her to serve as an advocate of public health, from which ethical
stance she argued that any of the scientists’ contested scenarios would
result in harm to humans.

This excerpt alone might not conclusively demonstrate that uncertainty
was a deliberate strategy of Carson’s, but the way she ended this section
strengthens the case. After telling her readers the most sinister features of
DDT (that chlorinated hydrocarbons freely cross the barrier of the placenta),
Carson (1962/2002) ended this passage with a double uncertainty quote:

All these facts—storage at even low levels, subsequent accumulation, and
occurrence of liver damage at levels that may easily occur in normal diets,
caused Food and Drug Administration scientists to declare as early as 1950
that it is ‘‘extremely likely the potential hazard [emphasis added] of DDT had
been underestimated.’’ There has been no such parallel situation in medical
history. No one yet knows what the ultimate consequences may be [emphasis
added]. (p. 23)

Her addition of the uncertainty quote from the FDA and the revision of ‘‘We
have some intimations,’’ from her earlier draft, to ‘‘No one yet knows’’
show Carson deliberately framing scientific facts with uncertainty, and in

Walker and Walsh

25

this final passage, she both began and ended with it. In both cases, she delib-
erately took out certainty and replaced it with uncertainty—first at the level
of ignorance and lack of consensus, then at the level of risk.

Similar revisions from certainty to uncertainty appeared throughout
her drafting process. In the chapter ‘‘Realms of the Soil,’’ Carson’s (ca.
1946-1962) early drafts stated, ‘‘As applications of pesticides continue
and the virtually indestructible residues continue to build up in the soil,
it is almost certain that we are heading for trouble.’’ In later drafts, Carson
crossed out the ‘‘we are heading for trouble’’ claim and instead entered
‘‘that we are pressing too hard against the limits of tolerance. The soil, for
all its capacity to absorb abuse, will one day strike back’’ (Early drafts,
chapter V). By the time she wrote the final draft, Carson had found nearly
the same idea in a consensus report of expert soil scientists:

These men summed up the hazards of using ‘‘such potent and little under-
stood [emphasis added] tools’’ as chemicals and radiation: ‘‘A few false
moves on the part of man may result in destruction of soil productivity and
the arthropods may well take over.’’ (p. 61)

Such apocalyptic predictions notwithstanding, her choice to frame even a sci-
entific source sympathetic to her argument against DDT with the uncertainty
topos is striking. The phrase potent and little understood again invoked ignor-
ance and risk; here uncertainty evoked an apocalyptic scene when it was
attached to such examples as a ‘‘take over’’ by the ‘‘arthropods.’’3

Tying the uncertainty topos to extreme possible futures, as Carson did in
these excerpts, forms a coherent and effective rhetorical strategy in this con-
text. We see it again in one of the last revisions Carson made before complet-
ing the galley proofs. In perhaps the most contested chapter about chemical
toxins and cancer, ‘‘One in Every Four,’’ Carson addressed the potential
effects of accumulating abnormally high levels of estrogen. Late drafts of this
section contained everything that appeared in the published version, except
for the second full paragraph on page 236. This paragraph resulted from an
earlier draft of the chapter Carson sent to Dr. George Crile, from the Cleve-
land Clinic, to check the facts. Crile heavily edited and critiqued Carson’s
claims, making the following comment at the end of the chapter:

I think you are on shaky ground genetically about mammals—I know of no
work that shows that even irradiation prior to conception causes any genetic
changes in mammals. My impression is that parts of this chapter are over-
written unless you preface these parts with the statement that these are your

26

Journal of Business and Technical Communication 26(1)

speculations and not established facts. (Carson, ca. 1946-1962, Early drafts,
chapter XIV)

To accommodate Crile’s critique, Carson (ca. 1946-1962) added another
paragraph to the final draft. In this paragraph, she first foregrounded the
uncertainty of medical opinion and then tied it to a fairly extreme case from
a scientific source:

Although medical opinion is divided [emphasis added] on the question, much
evidence exists to support the view that similar effects may occur in human
tissues. Investigators at the Royal Victoria Hospital at McGill University
found two thirds of 150 cases of uterine cancer studied by them gave evidence
of abnormally high estrogen levels. In 90 per cent of a later series of 20 cases
there was similar high estrogen activity. (p. 236)

Carson brought Crile’s critique into the discussion through a qualified
introductory clause that invoked ignorance. But the crux of her strategy
was tying that ignorance to a fairly extreme claim for the time—that high
estrogen levels can lead to cancer. How did this strategy maintain rheto-
rical coherence, and why opt for uncertainty over certainty in each of
these revisions?

From the patterns she had read in the contemporary literature—not only
from humanists such as Van Doren but from scientists such as Lehman—
Carson saw that uncertainty served to disrupt scientific assessments at the
lower stases and create there a site where the public could insert their fears
and values into the system, where they could drive scientific inquiry in the
form of problem setting, funding, and policy (Fleck, 1981). The extreme
potential effects were precisely what Carson needed to include in order
to attach readers’ emotional energy to the argument. That is the dual func-
tion of the uncertainty topos in conjunction with the is–ought divide:
Articulating scientific uncertainty at the is stases makes the science unre-
liable as a foundation for political action; elaborating dire possible futures
at the ought stases actualizes potential harm. Thus, uncertainty supplies
the rhetorical mechanism that ironically transforms scientific uncertainty
into political certainty.

Uncertainty’s dual function of disruption and actualization gives lay
readers the rhetorical grounds on which to draw their own inferences and
assert their right to know the potential hazards of environmental situations.
It also loosens the ethical handcuffs on the scientific writer. The writer’s
ethos changes from an authoritarian voice (‘‘Let me tell you what is’’) to
a more collaborative one (‘‘Let me tell you what we don’t know and what

Walker and Walsh

27

might happen’’). Uncertainty helps fulfill the prophecy of Carson’s book
that the public will decide for themselves.

Conclusion

In this study, we have traced Rachel Carson’s assimilation and revision of
the special topos of uncertainty from her scientific sources to her final drafts
of Silent Spring. We showed that scientific uncertainty could be analyzed
rhetorically as claims that, on one hand, destabilized scientific knowledge
at the lower stases of fact, definition, and cause and, on the other hand,
actualized the potential for harm at the stases of value and action. Carson
used this dual function of uncertainty to open up to public critique an essen-
tially scientific debate about the nature and effects of DDT; her dramatiza-
tion of possible risks invited her readers to manufacture political certainty in
the face of scientific uncertainty. These findings specify at least one way in
which uncertainty can be ‘‘translated’’ in public policy settings (Shackley &
Wynne, 1996) and revise previous hypotheses that articulations of uncer-
tainty generally serve to stymie rather than drive political action (Michaels,
2008; Mitchell, 2000; Oreskes & Conway, 2010; Paroske, 2009).

Our results also provide a different perspective on studies of linguistic
expressions of scientific uncertainty. Latour and Woolgar’s (1979/1986)
schematic suggested that the goal for scientists was to build scientific asser-
tions (type 4 statements) and have them accepted by the community with as
little uncertainty language as possible. In the case of Silent Spring, Carson
propagated public statements with high levels of uncertainty (types 1 and 2
statements) to erode the factual status of the safety of chemical toxins and to
provide a bridge for public valuation of science. Similarly, while a portion
of our data supports Fahnestock’s (1986) conclusion that popularizations of
science strip uncertainty and qualification from research articles, we also
found the reverse outcome: By injecting uncertainty at the lower stases,
Carson fractured the certainties of the research, and by doing so at the
higher stases, she engaged and motivated the public.

While we cannot say to what degree Carson’s uncertainty strategies were
responsible for the ensuing political actions that met Carson’s goal and cited
her book as motivation, we can compare our hypothesis to Murphy’s (2005)
analysis of the public letter writing in the year after Silent Spring’s publica-
tion. Murphy noted that although the writers of these letters shared informa-
tion and expressed gratitude, ‘‘the single most common impulse among the
letter writers was to evaluate and to take sides in an arena both implicitly
and explicitly public, with strong overtones of civic action’’ (p. 171). Both

28

the quantity and the quality of the public letter writing with its emphasis on
public service suggest that supporters were motivated to write and to
express gratitude to the author, the editors, and the publications for serving
the public interest. Furthermore, the wide circulation of Carson’s tome
throughout the media meant that people did not necessarily have to read the
book to feel compelled to comment on it, making it one of the most popular
‘‘unread books’’ ever written (p. 179). As Murphy suggested, Carson’s
audience preferred to spread the word rather than take direct action, and
‘‘the very fact that so many of the audience saw their role as extending the
reach of the message or its refutation indicates a strong sense of active and
public participation’’ (p. 180). Our results suggest that the rhetoric of uncer-
tainty has a large role to play in motivating public activity. But until we
have more studies that specifically examine the reception of Carson’s rheto-
ric of uncertainty by various members of the public, the media, and policy
makers, we will not be able to determine the extent to which uncertainty
was responsible for motivating public participation.

In fact, our next study will consider the articulation of scientific uncer-
tainty in the President’s Science Advisory Committee’s drafting process of
their seminal policy report on pesticides. Now that we have a baseline for
the common usage of uncertainty in postwar arguments about the intersec-
tion of science and society and a description of Carson’s adaptation of the
topos, we can add another stage to the evolution of scientific uncertainty in
American public argument, following Paul, Charney, and Kendall’s (2001)
guidelines for conducting principled reception studies. The Cold War
period was a time of proliferating risks due to the accelerating successes
of science and technology, and how these risks were communicated to the
public, either by scientists or by those who popularized their work, needs
further study. Special topoi of scientific argument can serve as useful
threads that pull through time to help articulate the texture of debates over
nuclear power, the environment, genetic engineering, and other sites of con-
nection between scientific and political rhetorics. We hope that the method
we have developed in this project will be a partial guide to scholars who
wish to pursue these interests.

Studies with this emphasis may help to shed some light on how the terms
of debate about the risks associated with increasingly specialized, expert-
driven, knowledge-production frameworks can be shaped for democratic
participation. For instance, if we look again at the debate between Block
and Jackson that opened this article, we can see that understanding the
history of the special topos of uncertainty gives us some traction on the
rhetorical strategies that both interlocutors used. Block, speaking on

Walker and Walsh

behalf of the public in her role as an NPR reporter, raised the specter of
ignorance to destabilize the foundation on which she inferred that Jackson
made the decision to allow the continued use of toxic dispersants; next,
she attempted to actualize the potential harm of the dispersants at the sta-
sis of value by emphasizing the extremes of the situation: ‘‘such quantities
and injected into such depths.’’

Jackson had clearly seen this strategy before because she immediately
countered on both fronts. First, she shored up her ethos as a scientist who
will ‘‘collect data every day and review the data to make sure we’re not
making a bad situation any worse’’; second, she offset the rhetorical damage
of Block’s ‘‘such quantities’’ and ‘‘such depths’’ with her own vivid actua-
lization of damage from the oil itself: ‘‘And remember, although these are
chemicals, they are less toxic than the oil [emphasis added], and we have
millions of gallons of oil being released out there.’’

An appreciation of the special functions of uncertainty open up this dialo-
gue to history: We can see how the legacy of the linear model, the is–ought
divide, and postwar articulations of uncertainty all continue to bear on present
environmental debates. Further detailed excavations of historical moments in
American public arguments about science will similarly increase our abilities
to understand, anticipate, and intervene therapeutically in future instances of
these complex and important public dialogues.

Appendix
Summary and Examples of Stasis Theory

Stasis theory derived from the system the Roman Senate used to investigate
and pass judgment on civic matters requiring political action. The system
persists in most Western democratic institutions, including American legisla-
tures and courts and academic fields, including science (Fahnestock & Secor,
1998; Walsh, 2009b). In Latin, the term means sticking points, steps, or lev-
els, and they progress from simpler to more complex, with an answer to a
question framed at one stasis turning into a question at the next step. Here
is an example of the system using the Deepwater Horizon incident:

Fact: What is happening in the Gulf? (A billowing black liquid mass is

spreading through the water.)

Definition: What is this billowing black mass? (An oil leak)
Cause–effect: What are the casual mechanisms of the leak, and what
effects do they have on public health? (An oil rig exploded due to

30

Journal of Business and Technical Communication 26(1)

negligence; oil in seawater may adversely affect public health if peo-
ple come in contact with it or consume contaminated seafood.)

Value: How do we collectively evaluate negligent oil companies and
environmentally triggered illnesses? (We think they are catastrophic
and merit political intervention.)

Action: What policies should we adopt to stop catastrophic causes and
effects of the oil leak? (Oil companies should be more strictly regu-
lated, and the oil should be kept from coming in contact with people.)

Walsh (2009b) noted how the lower stasis questions (fact, definition, and
cause–effect) are presently considered the province of scientists, at least
regarding environmental issues. But as an argument moves up the stases
ladder toward value and action, the questions require participation from
stakeholders outside the scientific community in order to establish criteria
(largely based on ontological questions of identity and values) for evaluation
and motivation for action. Walsh also noted that ‘‘the ‘is/ought’ schism
occurs between the stases of cause/effect and value’’ and that when one looks
at the particularly problematic stasis of cause–effect, we can witness how the
stases ‘‘exert an irresistible upward pull . . . because the answer to a question
at one stasis generates a question at the one above it’’ (p. 42). Stasis theory
shows the power of the old linear model of science–policy integration.

To demonstrate this ‘‘upward pull’’ of the stases and to show how it tends
to imbricate values even in questions framed at the lower stases, Walsh
(2009b) turned to Pielke’s (2007) ‘‘abortion politics,’’ a phrase used to
denote values-fraught civic issues:

If we state at the stasis of fact that ‘‘human fetuses have a heartbeat at N
weeks’’ we can immediately feel the policy-level implications of such a state-
ment—for example, ‘‘I believe nothing alive should be killed; therefore, abor-
tion is against my values,’’ and ‘‘I should vote against abortion rights.’’ (p. 42)

Sociologists of science continually point to how values determine not
only our relationship to facts but what is valuable to examine as objects
of scientific study and, most important, what is essential to fund. Thus, val-
ues permeate the entire argumentation and socially construct facts, defini-
tions, and cause–effect relationships within specific historical moments.

Notes
1. Although Mitchell (2000) did not deal with uncertainty explicitly as a strategy of
policy, he did imply multiple strategic purposes in describing how, given limited
information, worse-case assessments become routine and how, in some cases,
scientists downplay the uncertainties in their work to generate an authoritative
ethos and simplify public communication (pp. 93, 247).

2. Certainly many more microcodes of uncertainty appeared throughout the text
(whether, might, etc.), but we found that these microcodes were almost always
used in service of the five major codes, and so the cost of marking and transcrib-
ing them would have far outweighed the analytical benefits.

3. For all the lambasting Carson received for her alarmist portrayal of the chemical
pesticide problem, we were surprised by just how many egregious statements
came from the contemporary science. For example, ‘‘sea of carcinogens,’’ an
image Carson adapted, comes from a letter written to Carson by John J. Biesele,
a University of Texas Zoology professor. ‘‘Chemical death rain’’ (Carson, 1962/
2002, p. 12) is adapted from British zoologist, Charles Elton’s ‘‘rain of death,’’
his characterization of synthetic pesticides. In another instance, at the end of
chapter 12, Carson chose to not include the most horrific cases about pesticides
and neurological damage detailed in a report by Hayes (1956). Apparently, Car-
son also took up some alarmist rhetoric from ongoing conversations in postwar
science.
